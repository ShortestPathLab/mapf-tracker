### Results File Format (CSV)

Each results archive (zip file) contains a single file, with comma separated values, which describes best known results for a single grid map. The first line of the file is a header, which gives column names. Each subsequent line gives the corresponding values for a single problem instance. Where a best-known solution is available, we also give the corresponding plan. Further details about the solution plan format are available [here](http://tracker.pathfinding.ai/contributes).
