Browse results from path planning algorithms. For each submission, we record the number of instances where:

- **Solved:** The solution is valid.
- **Closed:** The solution is valid has a cost equal to the best (highest) lower bound.
- **Best lower bound:** The reported lower bound is highest.
- **Best solution cost:** The solution cost is lowest.

Note that we do not keep on hand the exact solutions for each algorithm. We keep only one representative _best solution_ for each problem instance.
