Browse state-of-the-art solutions for grid-based multi-agent
pathfinding (MAPF). Analyse trends, compare algorithms, or download the
dataset for your own use. These 2D grid benchmarks are sourced from Moving AI Lab. We categorised them into six domains: City, empty, game, maze random, and warehouse.

We generate problems with even and random agent placements, i.e.scenarios:

- Even: The distance between each agents' start and goal locations are roughly the same.
- Random: Agents' start and goal locations are randomly generated.

For each scenario, we record solutions for _n_ number of agents. These are termed _instances_.

Will we be able to fully solve and close these problems?
