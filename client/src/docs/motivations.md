In recent years, the number of publications on the topic of MAPF has exploded as industrial interest continues to grow. Many works now appear across various venues, and substantial performance improvements have been achieved. As a community, it is important for us to track the progress made in the field and establish the state-of-the-art together. Therefore this web-based platform is developed to track different types of algorithms and their progress. The two important results we collected from different MAPF algorithms are:

- Best (i.e., largest) lower-bound value.
- Best (i.e., smallest SIC) solution and its concrete plan.

To contribute new results, please modify your solver to return the CSV file in accordance with the Submission File Format, following the instructions provided below:

- For the solver that explores only feasible solutions, please report the lower-bound as empty.
- For the solver that attempts to prove optimality, please report the lower-bound value when the solver times out.

To upload your results to the platform:

- If you are interested in submitting results for a particular map:
  - Please contact one of the organizers, and we will create an account for you.
  - Once you have an account, you can contribute/upload-yourself individual solutions.
- If you want to contribute a large number of results:
  - Please contact us and we can organise a mass-upload facility.

Current Contactor:

- For submission, please contact Bojie.Shen@monash.edu or Zhe.Chen@monash.edu.
