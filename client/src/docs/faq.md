**Q1: I did not receive credit for all of my submitted results!**

- We validate all submissions for feasibility and reject any which are invalid. If you submit a best-known solution and the corresponding plan is invalid, we will not record any data for this problem.

**Q2: The number of claimed lower-bounds for my submission has gone down since it was accepted.**

- We compare lower-bound claims against best-known solutions. If your lower-bound claim X is contradicted by a feasible solution with cost Y < X, your claim is invalid and will be removed. In case of such errors, we remove all LB claims of the associated submission.

**Q3: Is there a convenient method to download all of this data?**

- Yes! Please visit our [download page](http://tracker.pathfinding.ai/quickDownload). The benchmark folder comprises snapshot files of all scenarios from the MovingAI repository, while the result folder houses solution plans from the best-known solution. You can conveniently download all the ZIP files using the wget command.

**Q4: I found a problem with the data or the website.**

- Please raise an issue in our issue tracker on [Github](https://github.com/bshen95/MAPF-benchmark-web). Describe the problem with as much detail as possible, and the steps leading up to the problem, so that we can reproduce it.
