MAPF Tracker accepts submissions in JSON, YAML, and CSV, as long as they include the following properties.

##### Properties

| Property  | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `map_name` | `string` (Required) | The name of the map |
| `scen_type` | `string` (Required) | Scenario type e.g.`even`, `random` |
| `type_id` | `number` (Required) | The scenario variant number |
| `agents` | `number` (Required) | The total number of agents |
| `solution_plan` | `string` (Required) | Your solution. This can be a list of path strings, or a single string with the path of each agent delimited by newlines. Paths can be run length encoded. |
| `lower_cost` | `number` | Theoretical lower-bound cost reported by your solver. If unknown, leave empty. |
| `solution_cost` | `number` | The cost of your solution. This is optional. If provided, this will be checked during validation. |

##### Examples

###### JSON

Solutions can be a list of strings or a newline-delimited string.

<CodeBlock language="json">
  {
  `
  {
    "map_name": "empty-8-8", 
    "scen_type": "even",
    "type_id": 0, 
    "agents": 1, 
    "solution_plan": "5r2d3w4d",  
  }
`.trim()
  }
</CodeBlock>

###### CSV

We accept only comma-delimitted CSVs. Which can be easier to output for some solvers. Each line of the file represents a solution. Solutions must be newline-delimited strings, Windows or Unix style. Booleans must be the literals `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

<CodeBlock language="csv-with-heading">
  {
  `
  map_name,scen_type,type_id,agents,solution_plan,flip_up_down
  "empty-8-8",even,0,1,"5r2d3w4dâ†µ5r2d3w4d",FALSE
`.trim()
  }
</CodeBlock>

###### YAML

We also accept YAML, which may be easier to output for some solvers. Solutions can be a list of strings or a newline-delimited string.

Multiple solutions can be batched into one YAML file. Note this is not possible with JSON.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
  {
  `

  # One submission
  map_name: "empty-8-8"
  scen_type: even
  type_id: 0
  agents: 1
  solution_plan: 
    - 5r2d3w4d

  # Another submission
  map_name: "empty-8-8"
  scen_type: even
  type_id: 0
  agents: 2
  solution_plan: 
    - 5r2d3w4d
    - 5r2d3w4d
`.trim()
  }
