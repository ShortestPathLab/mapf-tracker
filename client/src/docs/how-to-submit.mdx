Have an algorithm you'd like listed on the tracker? Here's how you can do it.

#### Submitting to the tracker in a nutshell

Submitting to MAPF Tracker is easy.

1. Request a submission (API) key. We'll ask you to provide some details and credentials related to your submission.
2. A team member will review your request. If accepted, they will email you with your submission (API) key.
3. Once you have your submission (API) key, you can start submitting your solution to the tracker. An automated process will validate your submission.
4. After you finalise your submission, your results will be reflected in the benchmarks.

#### Getting a submission (API) key

The submission (API) key allows you to submit solutions under your algorithm. It is a 32-character hexadecimal string. Each key is unique and can only be used once. Once it expires, you will need to request a new key. 

You can request for a submission key <Link href="/submit">here</Link>. We'll ask you some questions regarding you and your algorithm. Once we approve your request, we'll email you with your submission (API) key.

#### Submitting solutions

Once you've obtained an API key, you can enter it <Link href="/track">here</Link> to access a web console for uploading your solutions. You can upload data via any of the following methods:

- File upload via the web console (drag and drop)
- Copy and paste via the web console
- REST API

We'll automatically validate your submission and reject any invalid solutions. After you finalise your submission, your results will automatically be reflected in the benchmarks.

##### File upload

In the web console, click **Upload files**. In the dialog, open one or more valid files.

##### Copy and paste

In the web console, click **Copy and paste**. In the dialog, enter your solution data as one of the supported formats in the editor. Choose the appropriate format from the dropdown.

##### REST API

In the web console, click **REST API**. The dialog will show the endpoint to submit data to. Make a `POST` request to this endpoint with your data. Make sure to include the `Content-Type` header with an appropriate value.
