### The submission process

It's easy to submit your results to MAPF Tracker.

1. Request a submission (API) key [here](.). We'll ask you to provide some details and credentials related to your submission.
2. A team member will review your request. If accepted, they will send you an email with your submission (API) key.
3. Once you have your submission (API) key, you can start submitting your solution to the tracker [here](/contribute/submit-solution). An automated process will validate your submission.
4. After you finalise your submission, your results will be reflected in the benchmarks.
