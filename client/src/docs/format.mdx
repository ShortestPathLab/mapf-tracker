##### Solution string format

For each agent, we use a motion string to represent the path, where the symbol `u`, `d`, `l` and `r` represents moving up, down, left and right respectively, and `w` represents waiting at its current location.

For example, the path:

<CodeBlock>
{`(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0)`}
</CodeBlock>

is converted to a motion string:

<CodeBlock>
{`drruwl`}
</CodeBlock>

We use `\n` to separate the paths between different agents. Or, in supported formats, you can represent them as a list of strings.

###### Coordinate system

Coordinates should be using pixel origin, i.e. (0, 0) is in the top left corner of the map. This means that an agent with an increasing y-coordinate is going down, and should be represented by the character `d`.

For convenience, we offer a boolean property `flip_up_down`. If true, the coordinate system is reversed, i.e. (0, 0) is in the bottom left corner of the map.

###### Run-length encoding

Solution plans can be optionally run-length encoded before submission to keep file size low. For a sequence of repeated actions, such as `wwwww`, you can instead represent this as `5w`. Please encode single actions as `w` rather than as `1w`.
