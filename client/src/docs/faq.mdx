##### What should I do if my API key expires?

You'll need to <Link href="/submit">contact us</Link> to extend your API key's expiry, or request a new one.

##### What happens if I submit multiple solutions for a single problem instance?

Because a single submission key represents a single algorithm, you can only submit one solution per problem instance.

During submission, newer solutions for the same problem instance will overwrite older ones, even if the new solutions are invalid or worse.

##### Why did I not receive credit for all of my submitted results?

We validate all submissions for feasibility and reject any which are invalid. If you submit a best-known solution and the corresponding plan is invalid, we will not record any data for this problem.

##### Why did the number of claimed lower-bounds go down since my results were accepted?

We compare lower-bound claims against best-known solutions. If your lower-bound claim X is contradicted by a feasible solution with cost Y < X, your claim is invalid and will be removed. In case of such errors, we remove all LB claims of the associated submission.

##### Is there a convenient method to download all of this data?

Yes! Please visit our [download page](http://tracker.pathfinding.ai/quickDownload). The benchmark folder comprises snapshot files of all scenarios from the MovingAI repository, while the result folder houses solution plans from the best-known solution. You can conveniently download all the ZIP files using the wget command.

##### I've found a problem with the data or the website

Please raise an issue in our issue tracker on [Github](https://github.com/ShortestPathLab/winter-project-mapf-tracker/issues). Describe the problem with as much detail as possible, and the steps leading up to the problem, so that we can reproduce it.
